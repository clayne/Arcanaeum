Skyrim has an issue on ultrawide monitors. By default it will not provide options for 21:9 resolutions. This module 
fixes that by forcing the native resolution of the monitor on the game.


First of all we have to set the display settings in the ini file under `[Display]`:
```ini
[Display]
iSize H=1440
iSize W=3440
```
